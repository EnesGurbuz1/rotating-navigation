        <h1>The Best Places to Visit in Spain</h1>
        <small>culture trip</small>
        <p>
          Spain is the perfect destination for travellers looking for a European
          trip and, while the best-known spots are popular for a reason, it’s
          also full of hidden gems. Culture Trip has rounded up the best of
          both, from buzzing cities to quaint mountain villages. Here are the
          top places that will get you dreaming of a Spanish adventure.
        </p>
        <h2>Tenerife, for unique island landscapes</h2>
        <p>
          Tenerife, the largest of the seven Spanish Canary Islands off the west
          coast of Africa, might bring to mind package holidays and beaches, but
          there is actually so much more to see here. Away from the coast and
          the tourist hotspots the landscape is otherworldly, with volcanic
          peaks – Mount Teide is the highest peak in Spain – where you can
          explore the craters and ancient lava flows.

        />
        <h2>Alicante, for superb coastline</h2>
        <p>
          Sun, sea and a soaring rocky peak make Alicante a prime coastal
          destination. Many foreign tourists fly into the airport, then head
          straight out to resorts further along the coast – but they’re missing
          out, because Alicante is worth exploring in itself. The port city has
          a lively beach, with Mount Benacantil as a backdrop; Santa Bárbara
          Castle, dating back to the ninth century, sits at the top. Stroll by
          the marina in the evening before checking out the tapas bars in the
          old town.

        />
        <h2>Barcelona, for Gaudí architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The second largest city in the country is an eternal favourite with
          visitors, thanks to the stunning Mediterranean location, famous
          architecture and cosmopolitan atmosphere. Go gaga for Gaudí‘s
          architecture at Sagrada Familia and Park Güell – be sure to check out
          some of his lesser-known works too, such as Casa Batlló. Make the trip
          up to Mount Tibidabo for sparkling views across the city and the sea
          beyond. Rollercoaster fans, visit the Tibidabo Amusement Park, which
          opened in 1905. The mountain is also a great place for you to cycle or
          hike. Join our four-day Spanish Mini Trip to see Barcelona’s artistic
          side.

        <h2>Madrid, for world-class art</h2>
        <p>
          The Spanish capital is a must-visit for art lovers, with three
          world-class museums – the Prado, the Reina Sofía and the
          Thyssen-Bornemisza – all within walking distance of each other. The
          Prado is one of the world’s most important art galleries, with works
          by Spanish masters such as Velázquez and Goya, as well as
          international artists including Rubens and Bosch. The Reina Sofía is
          home to Picasso’s Guernica, while the Thyssen-Bornemisza has a
          collection of European art from the 13th to the 20th century.
